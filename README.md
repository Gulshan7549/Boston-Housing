Housing Data Analysis and Visualization

Introduction
This project analyzes housing data to identify significant factors affecting property prices. By exploring different features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax, the project aims to provide insights that can help real estate agents, policymakers, and potential buyers make informed decisions.

Problem Statement
Housing prices are influenced by multiple factors such as neighborhood crime rates, access to amenities, and quality of local infrastructure. Accurately predicting housing prices helps buyers make better decisions and assists local authorities in urban planning. This project explores these relationships using data analysis and visualization techniques.

Scope and Limitations
Scope
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature analysis and visualization

Basic statistical summary of the dataset

Limitations
Does not include predictive modeling (future work).

Limited to the available dataset (train.csv), which may not be representative of all housing markets.

Methodology
Data Collection: The dataset train.csv is loaded and explored.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding relationships between variables through visualizations.

Statistical Analysis: Computing summary statistics to understand the central tendency and spread of data.

Feature Correlation: Identifying correlations between different features to derive insights.

Dataset Description
The dataset train.csv contains information on various factors affecting housing prices. The key columns include:

crim - Crime rate per capita by town

zn - Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots

indus - Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

chas - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

nox - Nitrogen oxide concentration

rm - Average number of rooms per dwelling

age - Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940

dis - Weighted distance to employment centers

rad - Index of accessibility to highways

tax - Full-value property tax rate per $10,000

ptratio - Pupil-teacher ratio by town

black - Proportion of African-American residents

lstat - Percentage of lower status population

medv - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)

Theoretical Concepts
This project leverages the following concepts:

Descriptive Statistics: Used to summarize the dataset and understand the distribution of variables.

Correlation Analysis: Measures the relationship between different features to identify patterns.

Data Visualization: Utilizes histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots to reveal trends and anomalies.

Applications
The insights from this project can be applied in:

Real Estate: Assisting realtors in determining fair market values.

Urban Planning: Helping local governments analyze the impact of crime and amenities on housing prices.

Investment Decisions: Guiding investors in identifying high-growth neighborhoods.

Challenges and Future Work
Challenges
Incomplete or missing data for certain regions.

Potential multicollinearity between highly correlated features.

Future Work
Implementing machine learning models for price prediction.

Fine-tuning models to improve prediction accuracy.

Exploring additional datasets for better generalization.
